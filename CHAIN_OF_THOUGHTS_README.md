# 🧠 Chain of Thoughts (CoT) AI Reasoning System

## 🚀 Overview
The Chain of Thoughts (CoT) system is an advanced AI reasoning framework designed to simulate human-like cognitive processes. It breaks down complex problems into multiple reasoning steps, leveraging web search and machine learning to generate comprehensive insights.

## ✨ Key Features
- 🔍 Web Search Integration
- 🤖 10-Step Reasoning Process
- 📊 Confidence Scoring
- 🧠 Machine Learning Enhanced Reasoning
- 💾 Reasoning Trace Saving

## 🛠️ System Architecture
1. **Web Search Context Gathering**
   - Retrieves relevant web information
   - Extracts key insights

2. **Multi-Step Reasoning**
   - Systematic breakdown of problem
   - Iterative context refinement
   - Insight integration

3. **Reward Model**
   - Neural network for reasoning quality evaluation
   - Dynamically adjusts reasoning strategy

## 📋 Usage Example
```python
cot_system = ChainOfThoughtsSystem(max_reasoning_steps=10)
result = await cot_system.generate_chain_of_thoughts("What is the future of AI?")
print(result['final_conclusion'])
```

## 🔬 Reasoning Steps
1. Initial Context Analysis
2. Web Search Integration
3. Insight Extraction
4. Systematic Reasoning
5. Conclusion Generation
6. Quality Evaluation
